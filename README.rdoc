=== Difference between search engines
The main advantages of SphinxSearch is the fact that if you set many words to searching, this gives you results faster then SQL Engine.

<b>* SQL Engine:</b>
Takes words 1:1 if you match 'GUI Changes' this will be looking for "GUI" "Changes".

<b>* Thinking Sphinx Engine:</b>
Firstly search for words 1:1 after this substract last character ex. like: "Running"
 - Firstly "Running" 
 - "Runner"
 - etc.
